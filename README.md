# multi-agent-system

A multi-agent system using JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework).

Bank operations are part of oneâ€™s everyday life. That is why all banks strive to provide the best service to achieve customer satisfaction. Banks provide a lot of their services now online. However, a lot of services must be done in person at one of the bank branches.


In this case study, I investigate operations of a bank that has more than one branch ranging from headquarter, medium size to small size branches. The goal is to provide recommendation on how to best utilize services provided in each branch to reach customer satisfaction, which is basically represented as the total time a customer spends inside a branch to get his/her request done.
